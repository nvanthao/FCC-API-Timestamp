h1 API Basejump: Timestamp microservice

blockquote 
  | User stories:
  ol
    li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016) 
    li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
    li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
    
h2 Example usage:
code #{host}/December%2015,%202015
br
code #{host}/1450137600

h2 Example output:
code { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
